== Smartflix.com ==
 
Smartflix.com ran from 2001 to 2016.

It started as "Technical Video Rental", renting out a mix of VHS tapes and DVDs, via paypal buttons in a static HTML page.

It migrated to PHP (based on the ZenCart appplication). 

It got rewritten in Ruby on Rails 1.0, then upgraded to 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and then 3.0.

In 2014 the Smartflix corporation shut down and sold its assets to another firm that ran the service.
