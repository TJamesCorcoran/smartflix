to install
----------

0) unpack, put in your app's vendor/plugins

1) link from your project db/migrate to this plugin's db/migrate/1221860216_add_url_tracker.rb

2) in your application's app/controllers/application.rb, add this:

	  include UrlTracker
	  before_filter :url_tracker

3) in your customer login code, add this:

      UrlTracker

and right after a customer logs in, say like this:

      @customer = Customer.authenticate(params)	

add this:

      map_customer_to_session(@customer)

4) OPTIONAL (if you're using a bifurcated application/db model,
where your website data is pulled into another db and then that app
wants to use the data - Amazon.com, SmartFlix.com and HeavyInk.com do
this, you may or may not)

    in your (backend ?) customer model, put this:

		include UrlTracker
		def url_tracks() url_tracks_for_customer(self.id)  end
		def url_track_ids_for_controller_action(controller_str, action_str) 
		  ids_for_last_n_customer_actions(self, controller_str, action_str)
		end



5) rake db:migrate 


use
---

On the front end you can create a sidebar showing the customer things
he's recently looked at like this:


    @recently_viewed_videos = ids_for_last_n_session_actions(10, "store", "video").map{|id| Foo[id]}...

On the backend, you can send a customer email about things that he's looked at like this:

    Customer.find( XXXX ).url_track_ids_for_controller_action("store", "video")


bugs
----

* You might have multiple apps talking to the same db (like
  SmartFlix.com, Woodturner-U.com, Glasswork-U.com, etc.), and this
  plugin does not capture domain name ... and it should.


* We want session_id and customer_id to be indexes.
