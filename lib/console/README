Console
=======

Console is just a bunch of little utility functions that make working with the Rails console more of a pleasure than it already is.


Example
=======

Find record with ID=1:
Model[1]

Find all records with IDs between 1 and 4:
Model[1..4]

Find first 4 records with IDs greater than or equal to 1:
Model[1,4]

Find first record:
Model.first

Find last record:
Model.last

Find first record that attribute _foo_='bar':
Model.first(:foo => 'bar')

Find last record that attribute _foo_='bar':
Model.last(:foo => 'bar')
