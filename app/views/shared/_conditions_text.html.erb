AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS
---------------------------------

These Terms and Conditions are a binding Agreement between you and
Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix.  Please read them carefully.

Privacy
-------

We value your privacy.  Please see our 'Privacy Policy' for details.
It is incorporated into and made part of these Terms and Conditions by
reference.

Age
---

The SmartFlix service is available only to persons 18 or
over, and you certify that you are 18 years old or older.  This is
important to us both because of some states' limitations on the
enforceability of contracts with persons under 18, and also because
some of our videos involve training that may not be appropriate for
minors, at least not without parental consent.  You may, of course,
allow your children to select videos for rental, so long as you agree
to be responsible for their actions and bound by these Terms and
Conditions with respect to your children.

Care of Rental Merchandise
--------------------------

We don't care what you do with things you buy from us, but if you rent
it, we would like to be able to keep renting it to others. You agree
to treat the videos (and any accompanying packaging or instructions)
appropriately, giving them the care you would give to your mother's
best china.

Defective Merchandise

If you receive a product from us that is damaged and unplayable, you
may notify us of the condition in which it was received and exchange
it for another copy of the same title (provided copies are available),
exchange it for a different title, or keep a credit for a future
rental. You may also obtain a replacement or credit if our delivery to
you is lost in transit.

Billing
-------

You agree to pay the weekly rental rate for any merchandise you rent,
and authorize us to charge the credit card account you
provide.  Authorization to charge your credit card account
extends to subsequent weeks that you decide to keep it, and to the
replacement cost as described below. In the event that any authorized
charge is rejected, you agree to promptly pay using an alternate
method.  If we have not received a DVD back by a date one week before
your credit card expires, you authorize us to charge your credit card
for a replacement copy.  


Confirmation of Delivery of Rental Merchandise
----------------------------------------------

To save you money, we use first class mail to deliver rental
merchandise to you, and the Post Office does not offer delivery
confirmation as part of this service.

When we calculate that the rental merchandise should have arrived at
your address we will send you an email saying something like "it
should be there by now, please return it by date X".  If the item has
not arrived at your address, you agree to send us an email within two
weeks of our email.  You agree that if you do not send us such an
email, both you and we shall consider the merchandise to have been
delivered to you in good condition.


 
Return of Rental Merchandise
----------------------------

1. You agree to return the video within one week after it arrives.
That is, if it arrives on a Monday, you will return it by the
following Monday (or Tuesday, if Monday is a holiday). You will
include the packaging and any accompanying written material.

2. You agree to correctly secure the package for return shipment to
us, to prevent any loss of contents or damage.  You will use the
enclosed adhesive tabs and may use additional tape.

3. Pre-paid postage is included on the return packaging for shipments
from within the United States.  If you are returning it from outside
of the United States, you agree to affix the correct postage.

Rental Beyond One Week
----------------------

You agree that in the event you are late in returning the merchandise
or decide to keep it for more than just one week, you will be charged
additional weekly rental terms and authorize us to charge your credit
card account up to the replacement value.  That is because
if you keep it for more than one week, we cannot rent it to someone
else.  Unlike the typical video store that has a wall full the latest
releases stacked several deep, we often have only a single copy of any
given title.



University Billing
------------------


If you sign up for a SmartFlix University, you agree to allow us to
charge you the recurring monthly fee until you cancel your
subscription and return all DVDs.

If we have not received a DVD back by a date one week before
your credit card expires, you authorize us to charge your credit card
for a replacement copy.  


University Curricula
--------------------

If you sign up for a SmartFlix University, you agree that the
curricula may change after your date of singing up: titles may be
added or removed.


Failure to Return Merchandise
-----------------------------

You agree that if you fail to return the merchandise, or if you return
it damaged or destroyed, including because it was lost, damaged or
destroyed in transit because you did not properly secure the package,
or because your dog ate it or chewed on it, you will gladly (well, it
doesn't have to be gladly) pay for the replacement cost (including
taxes and shipping, plus a $10 fee to cover the cost of restocking),
and you authorize us to charge your credit card account for
that cost.  (Keep in mind that most of our videos cost more than the
mass-produced popular Hollywood films, and the replacement cost of
some of our videos may be several hundred dollars.)

If we are unable to charge the credit cards you provide us for late
fees, or university fees, for one or more months, this shall be
construed as a failure to return merchandise, and we will attempt to
charge you for replacement, as per above, through other means.

Copyrights
----------

Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix owns only lawfully made (i.e., non-infringing)
copies of the audiovisual works that it rents. But we do not own the
copyrights.  We can only transfer ownership (sale) or possession
(rental) of the disc to you, but we cannot and do not authorize you to
perform (i.e. play) the work publicly or to copy it.  You agree to
respect the copyright owner's copyrights, and that you will not
perform publicly or copy any of the videos, or any portion of the
videos, except with the permission of the copyright owner or as
permitted by law (see Title 17 of the United States Code, sections
106-122). Of course, you don't need anyone's permission to perform the
videos privately - that's what they are for - and you may play them
privately as many times as you wish before they are due back.

Technical Video Rental believes strongly in protecting the copyrights
of its suppliers. We do so because those copyrights enable them to
generate revenue to keep producing more quality products, and also for
purely selfish reasons: People who trade in pirated copies pay only a
small fraction of the price we pay for our legitimate copies, so they
will always be able to unfairly undercut out prices. Pirated copies
are often of inferior quality, which reflects poorly on the
author. Plus, for every person who watches the pirated video there is
one less potential customer for us, less revenue we can generate, and
less money we have to invest in more videos for you to enjoy.
Therefore, we will cooperate fully with any copyright infringement
investigation, and hope you will too.

Trademarks
----------

"Technical Video Rental", "SmartFlix" and the growing light bulb logos are
service marks of Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix. The trademarks of others may
identify the videos that we offer.  No license is being provided to
use any of these trademarks.

Linked Sites
------------

We may provide links to material on websites other than ours. We make
no representations concerning the accuracy of those sites or the
privacy or other policies of those site operators.

Your Contributions
------------------

We provide an opportunity for our customers to contribute reviews of
any products we offer using an interface for that purpose.  You agree
that if you choose to provide a review you are also providing your
permission to reproduce and post your review for public display on the
website. The same holds true for any unsolicited reviews you submit by
e-mail unless you conspicuously indicate at the beginning of your
review that it is "not for publication". And, although it goes without
saying, we will say it anyway: You agree that you will abide by the
law in all of your submissions, and take full responsibility if the
law should come knocking.  We hope you will also show good taste and
wonderful insight!

Warning and Disclaimer
----------------------

As the name implies, Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix offers instructional
videos and books of a "technical" nature.  This is not for the passive
entertainment of couch potatoes, but for people who want to learn new
skills - some of which can be quite dangerous if not
done correctly.  For that reason, even if you have a complaint with
the author of one of our videos or books WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR, IN NO
UNCERTAIN TERMS, that as far as Technical Video Rental is concerned
YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY for how you handle your newfound
training or knowledge. Also, if the disc jams your machine, it's not
our fault.

What does this mean?  It means that if you follow a video's
instructions and you cut your head off, or weld it onto some pipes,
you cannot and will not sue Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix, even if the
instructions on the video were bad and caused you to do so.  If you so
much as prick your finger with a needle while following sewing
instructions, or pass out at the beauty of your first oil painting, or
pull a back muscle lifting a piece of welding iron, it is all your
fault as far as Technical Video Rental is concerned.  Take it up with
the video publisher or your spouse, it you want to, but you agree to
leave us out of it.

That was the plain English version.  Since our lawyers like belts and
suspenders, we will say it again with lawyer words (sort of): By using
this website and/or renting or purchasing videos or books from through
this website:

1. You agree to assume all risks and to hold harmless Technical Video
Rental DBA SmartFlix, its employees and its owners for any injury or damage caused,
directly or indirectly, by the contents of any of the material you
obtain from us, including any instructions, illustrations or
demonstrations that you follow, and including any alleged failure to
include an adequate warning or safety alert.

2. You agree that any of these materials may contain information that
is inaccurate, incomplete, or downright confusing, such that following
it could cause injury to you or to others, or someone's property, but
paragraph 1 still applies.

3. You agree that we may say good things about a particular book or
video, or pass along good things others have said, and paragraph 1
still applies.

4. You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure the safety of
anything you do following the instructions or inspirations from these
materials, and paragraph 1 still applies.

5. You agree that there may be laws (including local laws, federal
regulations, permit requirements, or laws of nature) that may be
broken even if you follow the instructions to the letter, but even so,
paragraph 1 still applies.

6. You agree that all recommendations in books, videos, and this
website, for using tools, using processes, storage or use of products,
etc. are based on the author's knowledge at the time such
recommendations are made. Notwithstanding any such recommendations,
you as the user of tools, processes, products, etc., will make your
own determination and satisfy yourself that methods recommended are
suitable for your intended process or purpose, location, tools, etc.,
and that you are in compliance with environmental, health and safety
regulations, and paragraph 1 still applies.

7. You acknowledge that Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix does not vet
information provided in the books and videos offered for rental or
sale at this site, and that even when it sounds like we know what we
are talking about, you will not rely on it.  For example, if you read
on our site or in one of our e-mails that someone says "I think you'll
enjoy the video; I did," or similar phrases, you will not take it as
an indication that any particular video or book has been viewed or
read by any employees or owners of Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix, or that
there is any sort of expert review of materials offered for sale or
rental at Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix. In any event, paragraph 1 still
applies.

8. Finally, you agree that when discs are placed in players, bad
things may sometimes happen, and that in no event will Technical Video
Rental DBA SmartFlix be responsible for any damage resulting from the use of a
defective or incompatible disc - not even damage resulting from use of
a perfectly good disc.  (We will, of course, replace a defective
disc.)  In any event, paragraph 1 still applies.

Communications
--------------

You agree to provide us with an active e-mail address; you consent to
receiving business-related e-mail communications from us using that
e-mail address, and agree that notices relating to your account will
be effective if sent to the e-mail address you provided.

Disagreements
-------------

Let's hope we never have a disagreement we can't resolve in a minute
or two, but if it ever comes to litigation, you and Technical Video
Rental DBA SmartFlix agree that only the state or federal courts of Massachusetts
shall have jurisdiction over any dispute relating to Technical Video
Rental's service or these Terms and Conditions, that Massachusetts law
will apply, and that you irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue in these Massachusetts courts.

Changes
-------

Technical Video Rental DBA SmartFlix reserves the right to change these Terms and
Conditions at any time, but you will only be bound by the changes if
you continue to rent from us after the changes are posted.

Guarantees of 100% or Higher Refund
-----------------------------------


SmartFlix may, from time to time offer a guarantee of a 100% or higher
refund, for example a "120% refund".  If such a guarantee is offered
at the time you rent from us, the guarantee applies to dvds that you
rent and that we ship to you.  The guarantee does not apply to orders
that are cancelled before they are shipped, to late / extra week fees,
or to fees for the replacement of DVDs that you lose or fail to
return.  If the order in question is a university subscription, the
refund shall be limited to a single month's fees.  ( It's not fair to
eat at a restaurant six times, then complain that the soda was warm
every time and you want all six meals refunded, and we use the same
standard. )


Termination
-----------

You may terminate this Agreement at any time, provided that you have
returned (and we have received) all videos that you have rented, and
there is no further debt.  We may terminate this Agreement due to any
breach of it by you, or for business reasons.  The Privacy Policy,
Disagreements and Disclaimer terms, and any payment obligations, all
survive the termination.
