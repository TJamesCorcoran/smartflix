<%= @customer.first_name %>,

You've been enrolled in <%= @univstub.name %> for a while now,
and we'd like to ask a favor - could you please take a moment to write a
short review?

  <%= @review_url %>

We see the various SmartFlix Universities as a great tool, the best
bargain for people who want to learn new skills ... and as the future of the 
SmartFlix.

As a SmartFlix University customer, you are part of a very important
new direction for the company, and that's why we bend over backwards
to make sure that your experience is the best.

If you could take just a moment to do us a favor, we'd really appreciate it.  

Please leave just a few words about your experience with 
<%= @univstub.name %>: what you learned, how much you like it, if you
think of it as a way to save money, stay motivated in your hobby, or
whatever.

  <%= @review_url %>

We here at SmartFlix - Xxx, Pete, Laurie, Suz, and all the rest -
really do appreciate it!
