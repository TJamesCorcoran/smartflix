If you've been thinking you might like to try a new craft or maybe a
new technique but aren't sure if the right video is available, take a
look at what other customers have to say.  Reviews are at the bottom
of each DVD's page.  If you haven't posted a review yourself, please
do.  Your comments inspire us and might make all the difference to
another artist!


Here are some samples:


"This is an excellent video and I recommend it for anyone interested
in learning more about watercolor techniques." - D.S. on
<italic>Painting with Tony Couch</italic> (Painting: Watercolor)


"Excellent video! I wish I'd seen it years ago This video covers just
about all of it in around an hour, and the material is well organized
and very well presented. I'd particularly recommend this for people
who are new to sports photography." - P.K. on <italic>Digital Sports
Photography Made Simple</italic> (Photography)


"I love this DVD. Clear and concise, going through interesting
projects and clearly explaining how to use materials I have wanted to
use but was confused I have done several projects from both Tim Holtz
DVD's and never feel frustrated as I have with other instructional
projects." - T.A.S. on <italic>An Altered Journey: Discover the World
of Inks, Papers & Beyond</italic> (Scrapbooking)

Interview with Bonnie Staffel, Professional Potter and Video Producer

SmartFlix carries Bonnie Staffel's DVDs, <italic>Introduction to Wheel Work</italic> and <italic>Throwing with Slabs and Coils</italic>.  Bonnie has been a potter for 59 years and has been in business for herself for much of that time, with her first studio opening in 1965. We caught up with her recently, and here's what she had to say about making ceramics and teaching future potters.  Bonnie's website is http://webpages.charter.net/bstaffel, where you can see her beautiful pieces and buy directly from her.  For the full interview and her contact info (she welcomes questions and comments from other potters), see smartflix.com/blog.

<bold>SmartFlix:</bold> What do you draw your inspiration from?
<bold>B.S.:</bold> Usually from nature, or I go through a series in a new idea until I exhaust it.  When I had my own studio in Charlevoix [MI], I made a lot of utilitarian work for customers but still made one-of-a kind work/sculpture for my own satisfaction.  

<bold>SmartFlix:</bold>  What was the first video you made and what were you hoping to achieve 
with it?  Do you have any new videos coming out soon?
<bold>B.S.:</bold>  When I taught some classes at the Campbell Folk School, one of my student’s husband made a video of my work for his wife to practice from and I then produced it for sale.  That covered a lot of beginning processes as well as the start of my slab and coil process.
I would like to make a video of how to throw big pots using the Coil and Slab method.  Date is uncertain...  I am planning a trash can workshop for this fall and will have my photographer videotape it too.

<bold>SmartFlix:</bold> Tell us about your workshops.  What do you like for your students to learn from you?
<bold>B.S.:</bold>  I have used the Coil and Slab method for a very long time and was thinking that it is a real boon to potters who are aging and who do not want to give up working in clay.  Sometimes physical handicaps keep them from centering a ball of clay.  So I began to promote the Coil and Slab method to make it easier to continue to work without the former strength.  I also promote the acquisition of an extruding pug mill so that one doesn’t have to knead the clay any more.  
I have had all these years of experience as a dedicated potter so feel I have a lot to pass along to new students.  I contribute to clay forums on the Internet with that in mind.

<bold>SmartFlix:</bold>  Tell us about your trash can firing technique and what the results can be.
<bold>B.S.:</bold>  I have a long time friend who always worked in the metal arts.  He wanted to learn about clay, so I began his lessons with simple hand methods, then press molds.  Then he wanted to learn to throw.  (I would spend a week at his studio and then many hours on the phone with him answering his questions.) I knew he didn’t want to be involved in glazes so having experience with primitive firing and he being part native American, he also wanted to fulfill his creative work following the native methods to some degree.  So he dug a pit and we began that method of firing.  Now that I am back home, I do not have a way to have a pit nor do I have the energy to work as diligently as required.  I transferred the methods used in the pit to the trash can.  I even did it in a Weber Grill with success.  The kind of wood used, the chemicals added to the fire all contribute to the finished effect.  It is all by chance, by weather conditions, the wind, and the intenseness of the heat.  One can get a lot of colors from the chemicals and the final outcome is always a surprise and cannot be controlled.  The pit firing can usually take at least 24 hours, while the trash can firing can be accomplished in just two or three hours.  

<bold>SmartFlix:</bold>  Your contemporary pieces have fantastic texture through splashes and splotches of color.  Tell us a little about how you achieve that.  Is it an advanced technique or could a beginner see success too?
<bold>B.S.:</bold>  I have always experimented with clay, texture, and glazes that have variety in the visual surface.  With texture, I like a glaze that breaks with another color, or fumes to give a halo effect around the glaze on the open body.  I have always loved color in my stoneware pieces as well.  I use Mason Stains as one would use watercolors.  I am familiar with what my glazes and accent glazes will do so can use them as a painter would use paints.  It all comes from experience and knowledge of your materials.  While a beginner is anxious to get beautiful results, I feel that they learn more from their mistakes than from success.  I am always available to help the newcomer when they need help to get launched.  The field of ceramics is so vast, that no one could ever know all about it.

contains the Bristol Center for Arts & Culture and is featuring the
works of Connecticut painter, Glo Sessions. We love museums that feature local
art!  ~ www.thecarouselmuseum.org/about.html
