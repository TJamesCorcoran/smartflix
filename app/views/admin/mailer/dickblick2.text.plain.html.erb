It's your last chance to win top-quality painting gift sets (and there are just 6 days left!).

A few weeks back, we wrote to tell you about your chance to win one of
three painting sets.  This is the second, and final, email we'll be
sending about this promotion.

Now, we're getting down to the wire: there's less than one week left.
On July 31st, at 11:59 pm, the contest is over.  Don't miss your last
chance to win!

How do you enter to win?  Just rent any arts & crafts video from
SmartFlix between today and August 1st.  Every video you rent is a a
whole 'nother chance to win.  Rent one video, and you've got one shot;
rent 7 arts & crafts videos (maybe the 4-DVD 'You Can Make It Sewing'
set and the 3-DVD 'Painting the Head in One Sitting' set, and you've
got 7 times as many chances to win!).  Renting ANY arts & crafts DVDs
from SmartFlix will enter you into the contest, even if it's not a
painting instructional DVD.
