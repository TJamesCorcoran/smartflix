Here in the SmartFlix office, we've been wearing our cool company
T-shirts for a few months (we've been removing them to wash them, of
course!).  Employees have been sneaking into the stock room to grab
extras for their spouses, parents, and friends, and we've had a lot of
people around town ask us how they can get a shirt of their own.

We've decided that we shouldn't keep shirts that look this good to
ourselves, so we've decided to give them away.

Here's how it works:

* we've created a personalized link to SmartFlix just for you:

	http://smartflix.com&ct=cf<%= @object.id %>

* forward this URL to friends via email, or cut-and-paste it into your blog

* if two or more people come to SmartFlix via your personalized link
  and become customers, we'll ask you your t-shirt size, and mail you
  a brand-spanking-new T-shirt.

The T-shirts are Anvil-brand, Super Heavyweight (6.1 ounce) 100% cotton.

They come in any color you want (as long as it's black), and have the
SmartFlix light-bulb on the front, and the full logo on back.

These shirts look great on men and women, young and old, painters,
welders, hotrodders and glass-blowers.  They're perfect for every
occasion from doing errands around town to working in your shop or
studio (but note: they do not magically repel oil paint, hot glass,
or welding spatter, so exercise normal caution!).

So, in summary: Send your personalized SmartFlix link to your friends,
convince them to check out our service, and get a super-slick t-shirt.

Here's the link one more time:

	http://smartflix.com&ct=cf<%= @object.id %>

We're looking forward to handing out a bunch of shirts!



The fine print:
* void where prohibited by law
* maximum one shirt to a customer
