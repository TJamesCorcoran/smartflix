Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

Thank you for your order!

Despite having multiple copies of our more popular videos, unfortunately
these video(s):

  <% @unfulfilled_titles.each do |title| %>
    * <%= title.name -%>
  <% end %>

can not ship out immediately.  Usually this is because videos are out
of stock right, but sometimes it's because one video is out of stock,
and another video follows that in a sequence (you don't want us to
ship you Advanced Super Duper Dog Washing if we aren't going to ship
you Basic Dog Washing at the same time, or earlier!).

Videos come back from customers every single day, and, because SmartFlix
is growing rapidly, we place multiple orders with our vendors each week.
Thus, we expect that your titles should be in stock pretty soon: most
videos come back within a week.

As soon as one or more of your videos are in stock they will be
shipped out to you, and you will be alerted by email that they are on
the way.  If you ordered multiple videos, don't worry - we won't wait
until everything is in stock (of course, we'll make sure that we don't
ship sets of videos out of order!).  We'll gladly eat the extra
postage to get you each of your videos as soon as possible.

NOTE: there is *NO* need to replace your order; your order remains on
file, and we will ship it ASAP.

We apologize for this delay, and thank you for patience.


Your friends at SmartFlix.com
