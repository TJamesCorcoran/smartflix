This directory ( app/views/university_mailer/ ) is part of the
SmartflixU project, but is also "linked" to (as an "svn extern") from
the railscart project.

It would be nice if we could have action mailer templates in the
"smartflix_u_components" plugin, but that's apparently a hassle.

This is good enough.
