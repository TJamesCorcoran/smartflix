Hi <%= h(@customer.full_name) %>,

Once you're there, just update your password to a new one that you'll
easily remember. After you've made that change you can login to your
account as usual, using your new password. Just contact us if you have
any problems, and we'll get them straightened out.

If you did not request a password reset, please report this email by

Thanks for your business!
