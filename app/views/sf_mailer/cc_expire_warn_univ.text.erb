Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

We're thrilled that you're enjoying your <%= @order.university.name %>
subscription, but we're worried that your credit card ( <%= @customer.last_to_expire_credit_card.name %>)
is going to expire soon.

As per the terms and conditions of <%= @order.university.name %>, we
need a new credit card from you, or we'll have to charge you the
replacement cost of the DVDs you have out.

We don't want to charge you - we want you to keep enjoying and
learning from <%= @order.university.name %>!

Please go here

   http://smartflix.com/customer/manage_cc

and give us a new up-to-date credit card before
<%= @customer.last_to_expire_credit_card.charge_date_before_expire %>.

If you have any questions, please contact us at info@smartflix.com.

As a courtesy, we'll send this reminder to you once per week, until we
get a new card.


Thank you,

Your friends at SmartFlix.com
