Hi <%= @customer.full_name.andand.titleize %>,

We appreciate you dropping by SmartFlix!  You probably looked at a lot
of cool videos, and we wanted to remind you that over <%=
((Customer.count / 10000 ) * 10000).commify %> other folks have learned about <%=
(@toprated_titles_by_cat.keys.map(&:good_human_name) << "other how-to skills").to_sentence  %>

The vast majority of these DVDs are in stock, ready to be shipped right out to you!


<% # XYZFIX P2: we're ignoring the @toprated_titles_by_cat ...      %>
<% @browsed_titles_by_cat.keys.each do |cat| %>
  <%= cat.name %>
  <%= "-" * cat.name.size %>
<% @titles = @browsed_titles_by_cat[cat] + @toprated_titles_by_cat[cat] %>
<%= render :partial => 'mailer/product_listing_with_reviews_TEXT', :locals => {:products => @titles, :token => @token, :ctcode => @ctcode }  %>
<% end %>

As you know, most of our DVDs are just $9.99 for the first week (and a
whole lot less for optional additional weeks!), and we cover shipping
both ways.

Sincerely,

Your friends at SmartFlix
