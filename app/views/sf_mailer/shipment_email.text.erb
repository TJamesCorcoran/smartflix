received the wrong title, just visit your history page and tell us about
it. We'll fix it ASAP.

<% if @unfulfilled_titles.size > 0 -%>
<%   if @customer.shippable_count_for_sf > 0 -%>
Out of stock
------------

Sometimes, no matter how many copies we have in stock, our most popular
DVDs, like

<% @unfulfilled_titles.each do |title| -%>
    * <%= title %>
<% end -%>

are out. But, rest assured, your DVD will be back in stock soon and out
the door to you.

As soon as the next available copy is returned to our shipping center,
we'll get it right in the mail. We'll also send you an email when we do,
so you can plan your project.

Scheduled shipments
-------------------

Your current setting for how many videos you'd like at a time is <%= @customer.ship_rate %>.
We'll ship your next batch of videos in one week, right around the time
you're done with these and ready to send them back! Here are the videos
we'll be shipping to you in the near future:

<% @unfulfilled_titles.each do |title| -%>
    * <%= title %>
<% end -%>

You can change the number of videos you receive at a time on your
customer settings page, available here:

  http://smartflix.com/customer/account_info
<%   end -%>
<% else -%>
All videos you've ordered in time for today's shipments have been
shipped.
<% end -%>

Tracking Numbers
----------------

There are no tracking numbers. Why? The U.S. Post Office doesn't give
tracking numbers for their First class or Media mail. But we'd certainly
give them to you if we had them.

Shipping
--------

Your package will be hand packed at our shipping center, picked up by
the friendly folks from the post office, and shipped via USPS First
Class Mail. Estimated arrival dates are listed below. Some locations,
like Canada and Hawaii, may take a bit longer.

Our mail goes out every day, Monday through Friday.

USPS goes out on:            <%= @shipment.posted_on.strftime("%d %b %Y") %>

Earliest expected delivery:  <%= @shipment.early_arrival.strftime("%d %b %Y") %>

Later expected delivery:     <%= @shipment.late_arrival.strftime("%d %b %Y") %>


Thanks,

Your friends at SmartFlix.com


P.S. Remember to open the envelope or box carefully because you'll use it again to
return the DVD(s).
