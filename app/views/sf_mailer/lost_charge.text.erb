Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

We're writing today about one or more lost DVDs.  We've purchased replacement
copies, and we've charged you for the replacements.

<% if @because_cc_expiring %>

These DVDs were out with you and the credit card we have on hand for
you is due to expire shortly, so we will no longer be able to charge
you weekly rental fees, and instead have to mark these unreturned DVDs
off our books, as specified in the previous weekly charge emails you
have received.

<% end %>

The copies we shipped to you have now been marked in our database as
no longer belonging to us - if they are still in your possession, they
are yours to keep.

<% @copies.each do |copy| %>
* Copy #<%= copy.id %> of '<%= copy.product.name %>'.
  Replacement price:  $<%= copy.replacement_price %>

<% end %>

All prices above include our estimate of the actual taxes, shipping,
handling that we pay to replace the DVD, as well as a restocking fee
to cover the labor and office overhead involved in purchasing a
replacement and adding it to our inventory ( $10 ).

Because we want to keep your costs as low as possible, we always buy
replacements from the lowest cost vendor that we can find.

Your credit card ending in x<%= @last_four %> was charged
$<%= sprintf("%0.2f", @sum_price) %> on <%= Date.today.to_s %>
