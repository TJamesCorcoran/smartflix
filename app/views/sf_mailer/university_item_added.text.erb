Dear <%= h(@customer.full_name) %>,

Based on customer requests, we just added a new video to
<%= @university.name %>.  Because most customers want to get all of the
DVDs in a university, we've added this to your subscription.

Here's the description of the video:

    <%= @product.name %> by <%= @product.author.name %>

<%= word_wrap(@product.summary(400), :line_width => 60).gsub(/^/, " " *4) %>

...but if you don't want this DVD, you can remove it this page:

     <%= url_for(:host => WEB_SERVER, :only_path => false, :controller => :customer, :action => :university_status) %>

Just scroll to the bottom of the "DVDs yet to be sent" list, find the
DVD, and click "cancel".

Speaking of changing the items in your queue, you can also go anywhere
on the website and add new videos to your university by clicking an
"add to queue" button.  For example, to add Arc Welding to your
university, go here and click the "add to queue" button.

     <%= url_for(:host => WEB_SERVER, :only_path => false, :controller => :store, :action => :video, :id => 11) %>

And, as a reminder, you can change the rate at which you get DVDs at
this page:

     <%= url_for(:host => WEB_SERVER, :only_path => false, :controller => :customer, :action => :change_plan) %>

If you ever have a question, a suggestion, or a comment, please contact

We read every single customer email, and we look forward to making you
as satisfied with our service as the thousands of others who've rented
from us since 2002.

Sincerely,

Xxx, President
