Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

As a SmartFlix customer, you're welcome to keep DVDs for as long
as you want (or send some back earlier, and hang on to others), but we
do charge <%= number_to_currency(@weekly_rate) %> per week, or fraction of a week
(the fee for a few premium DVDs is slightly higher).

The following DVDs have been out an extra week, or an extra fraction
of a week:

<% @copies.each do |cc| %>
* <%= cc.product.name %> ( copy #<%= cc.sticker_id %> )
<% end %>

Today we charged your credit card ending in x<%= @last_four %>
<%= number_to_currency(@price) %> for this extra time.


<% if @in_last_chargeable_month %>

Please note that the credit card we have on hand for you is due to
expire shortly.  Please go to your account page

   http://smartflix.com/manage_cc

and give us a new up-to-date credit card.  If we don't receive one by
the end of the month, we'll have to charge you for these unreturned DVDs.

<% end %>

Thank you,

Your friends at SmartFlix.com
