Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

<% if @order.univ_status == :cancelled_in_field %>
Your  <%= @order.university.name %> subscription is marked 
as cancelled, but you still have DVDs that you haven't sent back yet.  Until we get
them back, the monthly fee applies.
<% end %>

We tried to put through the monthly charge for your <%=
@order.university.name %> subscription, but we don't have a working
credit card for you.

The error we got was

  <%= @details %>

If you've fixed the issue with your credit card, you can go here

   http://smartflix.com/customer/university_status

and click "try the card again"...

... or you can go here

   http://smartflix.com/customer/manage_cc

and give us a new up-to-date credit card.

<% if @copies.any? %>

It's important that you update your credit card information ASAP.  You
currently have DVDs out in the field, and the monthly charges can
accrue from month to month!

<% end %>

Thank you,

Your friends at SmartFlix.com
