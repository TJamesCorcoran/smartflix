<p>Hey, it's Xxx - founder of SmartFlix (the how-to DVD rental
company) - here.
</p>


<p>One of the must frustrating things for me is when I want to do
something and just don't have the skills.  I remember in my early days
of woodworking when I'd try to use a hand-plane to shave just a hair
off a board, and I made a complete hash of it, ripping up the wood.
Or in my early days of cooking, I'd take an expensive steak and then
end up screwing it up and ending up with a "meh" (as the kids say)
result.
</p>


<p>For you, maybe it's not woodworking that you want to learn more about,
but <%= @univ.name_verb.downcase %> or something else.
</p>


<p>Like you, though, I'm passionate about learning, and I don't like to
let failures stand.  I need to get back on the horse.
</p>


<p>In the end, I mastered both the intricacies of adjust a hand plane AND
all sorts of cooking skills (cooking the perfect steak, deep
frying a turkey, cracking an egg one handed).
</p>


<p>One thing I've noticed is that it's a lot easier to learn from video
than from books.  Someone can talk about how to hold and use a hand
plane, or a paint brush, or a MIG welding gun until the cows come
home, but there's no substitute for watching it and really GETTING IT.
</p>


<p>SmartFlix is the solution to this problem: we send how-to DVDs to your
home Don't you hate feeling rushed when you rent a how-to DVD for just
one week?  With SmartFlix Universities, you can rent all the how-to
DVDs you want, on whatever topic you want (Cooking, Woodworking, Oil
Painting, Metalworking, and dozens more) and get to keep the DVDs for
as long as you want with no late fees.
</p>


<p>Seeing is believing, and we don't want you to take OUR word for how
great a subscription is.  We want you to try it - for free!

</p>


<p>You can cancel at any time you want.
</p>


<p>Whether you stick around for two years, or just two weeks, the first
month is 100% free.  Yes, that's right - a full month of how-to DVDs for free.
</p>


<p>How-to DVDs are pricey to buy - most of them cost a lot more than the
DVDs you might buy at Target or Costco.  I love picking up "Iron Man
2" for $11 as much as you do, but the average price of a how-to DVD is
over $40 - with many titles selling for $80 or more.
</p>


<p>To buy three how-to DVDs per month you'd spend over $120.  That's
$1,440 per year.  A ridiculous amount, and if you're anything like me,
that doesn't fit in your budget!  But think about the amount of value
there: $1,440 worth of knowledge on hard-to-learn topics like expert
oil painting, machinist skills, blacksmithing, wood carving, wood
turning, and more.
</p>


<p>And now SmartFlix has a solution: the ability to view this huge
library of great how-to information for almost nothing.
