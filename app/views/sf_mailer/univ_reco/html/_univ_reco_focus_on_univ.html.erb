</p>


<p>How-to DVDs are pricey to buy - most of them cost a lot more than the
DVDs you might buy at Target or Costco.  I love picking up "Iron Man"
or some other action movie for $11 as much as you do, but the average
price of a how-to DVD is over $40 - with many titles selling for $80
or more.
</p>


<p><%= @univ.name %> has tons of great DVDs - favorites picked from our
collection by the ratings of our customers.
