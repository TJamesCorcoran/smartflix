Hi <%= @customer.first_name %>,

We just want to remind you that you rented <%= "DVD".pluralize_conditional(@copies.size) %>
that we haven't received back yet:

<% @copies.each do |cc| %>
* <%= cc.product.name %> ( copy #<%= cc.sticker_id %> )
<% end %>

You're welcome to keep these DVDs for as long as you want, but we do
charge <%= number_to_currency(@weekly_rate) %> per week, or fraction of a
week (the fee for a few premium dvds is slightly higher).


Thank you,

Your friends at SmartFlix.com
